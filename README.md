# Bioinformatics_TeachableUnit

## You've Caught Them All!...now what?

This repo contains teaching materials for a teachable unit aimed at introducing undergraduates to Bioinformatics. Students learn about the role of bioinformatics in phylogenetics by situating Pokemon in the Tree of Life.

These materials were created by Janelle Nunez-Castilla, Emily Warschefsky, and Laura Timm for the Scientific Teaching and Outreach Workshop offered at Florida International University in Spring 2017. This workshop was led by Sarah Eddy and Melissa McCartney.

If you use any part of these materials, please credit J Nunez-Castilla, EJ Warschefsky, and LE Timm.
